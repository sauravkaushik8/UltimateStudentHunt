# UltimateStudentHunt

Ultimate student hunt was a week long Data Science competition organised on Analytics Vidhya : https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/the-ultimate-student-hunt/

I managed to secure a top 30% finish in this competetion by using feature engineering and building a GBM model.

It was a very challanging competition with plenty of takeaways.
